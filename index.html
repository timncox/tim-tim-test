            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>The story begins during China's Cultural Revolution, where Ye Wenjie witnesses her father's death at the hands of Red Guards. This traumatic event shapes her worldview and eventually leads her to make a decision that will affect all of humanity. Years later, she becomes involved with a secret military project at Red Coast Base, which is actually a facility for extraterrestrial communication.</p>
            
            <p>In the present day, nanomaterials researcher Wang Miao is drawn into a mysterious series of events, including inexplicable suicides among scientists and strange phenomena in his research. He discovers a virtual reality game called "Three Body," which simulates a world with unpredictable periods of chaos and stability due to the gravitational interactions of three suns.</p>
            
            <p>The game turns out to be a recruitment tool created by the Trisolarans, aliens whose civilization faces destruction due to their planet's unstable orbit around three suns. They have received Ye Wenjie's message and are now heading to Earth, though their arrival will take centuries. This revelation divides humanity into groups that either welcome or oppose the alien invasion.</p>
